Boat Texture Generator Tool <br> 
**WIP At the moment**

<br>
<br>

There is a `grayscaled.png` image which is a b/w version of Oak boat, to make a b/w version of another type of boat put 
name the texture as `boat.png`

`planks.png` is the texture of the wooden planks
`output.png` will be the resultant boat texture

**Note:** The tool breaks if you have a *dark* wooden texture, the boat texture it generates will be bad

<br>


*The textures it generates are just a tinted oak boat texture, I'm working on improving it to not just be a simple tint :pain:*
